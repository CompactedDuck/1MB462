Genome Analysis Project

This class project is based on the article by Zhang et al. "RNA-seq and Tn-seq reveal fitness determinants of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during growth in human serum". Enterococcus faecium is a bacterium normally found in the human gut, which can cause bloodstream infections in hospital patients. 

The main objectives are as follows:

* Assemble genomes for E. faecium genome using both long read (PacBio) and hybrid (Illumina + Nanopore) methods
* Evaluate and analyse E. faecium genome assemblies using multiple methods
* Use RNA-Seq data to determine differential gene expression for E. faecium in human serum and rich medium
